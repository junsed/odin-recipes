    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There's exactly three places in the world where you get the best dosas, they are the masters of their craft and no one else even comes close. Here they are -
        <strong>in no particular order!</strong> </p>
    <ul>

    </ul>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Just grab a readymade dosa batter from your local grocery store.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="chen">I personally prefer the batter made by <a href="http://chennaicaters.com/">Chennai Caters</a>,
        but any other brand will work just fine.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You will need a non-stick tawa. <em>Duh.</em></li>
        <li>You will need a wood spatula. Yes, <strong>wood</strong>! Not metal or silicon spatulas. </li>
        <li>You will also need a gallon or two of ghee (<em>clarified butter</em>), see I am saving you the trouble of
            googling what ghee means. <em>Am I awesome or what?</em></li>
        <li>Lastly, if you can lay your hands on this, buy a shit ton of the <em>pudi</em> that's available at <a
                href="https://www.google.com/search?q=umesh+dosa+point&source=lmns&bih=649&biw=1440&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwio5p-S6afzAhUBhXIEHQZeBOgQ_AUoAHoECAEQAA">Umesh
                Dosa Point.</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="chen">Oh, by the way, the <em>pudi</em> is also called gun powder. <strong>Yes, that dosa be smokin'
            hot.</strong></p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fire up the stove on medium, heat up the tawa. <em>Add a little ghee or cooking oil so as to avoid the dry heat
                up which can ruin your tawa.</em></li>
        <li>Pour a spoonful of the batter in the centre and spread out from the center in an elliptical shape.</li>
        <li>If you have that <em>pudi</em>, spread it across the batter with your fingers.</li>
        <li>Drop dollops of ghee across the length and breadth of dosa. My mantra here is <em>the more, the
                merrier.</em></li>
        <li>The dosa will start turning brown all around and you will see the edges start to lift of its own accord,
            wait a minute more if you want it more crispy.</li>
        <li>Fold the dosa with the wooden spatula and you are now ready to consume something that is out of this world.
        </li>
    </ol>
